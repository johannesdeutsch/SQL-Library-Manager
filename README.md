# Project 6 SQL Library Manager
 Treehouse Techdegree Project 6

Here I worked on a new app for library employees. It retrieves book entries from a SQL database and shows them on several pages. Furthermore it offers a search field to find books, and it doesn't matter if the user enters parts of words, in lower or upper case or which elements (title, author, publishing date etc.) are searched for. There are also seperate pages for new book entries, editing the data or deleting it. The sites are produced with PUG, node.js, SQLite, Express, JavaScript, CSS and the SQL ORM Sequelize.
